## About Me

I am a Senior Statistician with an MSc in Medical Statistics and a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and programming. I have experience working with diverse datasets, from early-phase clinical trials to large-scale public health data, using tools such as **Python, R, SQL, and SAS**. I am passionate about transforming data into clear, compelling narratives that inform strategic decisions and improve outcomes.

Beyond project work, I have contributed to scientific research through peer-reviewed publications.

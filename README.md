# ðŸ“Š Data Science Portfolio by Lesedi Ledwaba-Chapman

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio!  
This repository showcases projects where I analyse complex datasets, apply statistical and machine learning methods, and communicating insights clearly.  
The projects emphasise data storytelling, problem solving, and data-driven decision-making.
